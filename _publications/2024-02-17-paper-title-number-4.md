collection: publications
category: underreview
permalink: /publication/2026-02-07-physics-based-encoder-only-transformer
excerpt: 'This study proposes a Physics-based Encoder-only Transformer (PET) model for unified hysteresis modeling. It incorporates relative positional encoding and physics-informed learning biases based on Drucker’s postulate to ensure physically consistent predictions across diverse structural behaviors.'
